Each scene can have an script (probabilly added using the editor)
This script can have up to the following three methods:

init () {
	
}

update () {
	
}

deinit () {
	
}

bazinga.scene can be used from object scripts to share global info.
The same object can also be acessed from the scene script.

scenes can load other scenes using the method:

bazinga.load_scene(fileName)

Also:

bazinga.quit()

can be used to quit the engine.

Maybe a bazinga.scene_pause(), wich would not run chipmunk/put dt to zero

CALLBACKS MUST BE REFACTORED! Because if it is not, you cannot change the callbacks for different scenes. So it needs to be inside the scene script.

(what means, we will turn callbacks INTO the scene)
